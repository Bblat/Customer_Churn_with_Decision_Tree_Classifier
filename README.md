# Customer Churn Model
This repository contains code for a customer churn model built using the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn. It also includes a confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.

# Introduction
The customer churn model is designed to predict customer churn based on a set of features. Churn refers to the phenomenon of customers ending their relationship with a business or service. This model can help businesses identify potential churners and take proactive measures to retain them.

# Installation
To use the customer churn model, you need to have Python and the following dependencies installed:

- scikit-learn
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
You can install the required packages using pip:

  ```pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn```

# Usage
To use the model, follow these steps:

- Clone or download this repository.

- Open the customer_churn_model.ipynb Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

- Upload the WA_Fn-UseC_-Telco-Customer-Churn.csv CSV file to Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

- Run the notebook cells to execute the code and see the results.

The notebook contains the implementation of the customer churn model using the DecisionTreeClassifier. It also includes the code for generating a confusion matrix and classification report to evaluate the model's performance.
